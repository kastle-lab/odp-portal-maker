##   Association for Ontology Design & Patterns (ODPA)


Welcome to the main page of the Association for Ontology Design & Patterns (ODPA). The ODPA’s goals are to promote high-quality ontology design and engineering, with a focus on methods and tools arising out of ontology design patterns. In particular, the ODPA 



1. runs an annual workshop on ontology design and patterns ([WOP](WOP%253AMain.html "WOP:Main")),
2. maintains the ontologydesignpatterns.org portal ([this site](http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/ "http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/")),
3. runs a public mailing list related to ontology design and patterns ([a Google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/ontology-design-patterns "https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/ontology-design-patterns")), and
4. engages in additional activities to promote ontology design & patterns, including the provision of dissemination materials, educational activities, and engagement with researchers and practitioners.

###   Organisation


For details of the ODPA mission and organization, see the [current ODPA charter](images/a/a3/ODPA-approved-charter.pdf "ODPA-approved-charter.pdf"). The ODPA was formed in 2016.


The ODPA is run by a board, consisting of regular board members, a managing committee, and a set of executive members. In addition to the board, the association has a set of regular members, mainly former board members and WOP chairs. Most activities of the ODPA, such as the WOP workshop, mailing list etc. are open to anyone, regardless if they are members of the ODPA or not. Only at the yearly meeting, where the board is elected, is it required to be a member in order to be eligible for voting - although the meeting as such will be open to anyone.
